## Monitoring

### Connection monitor
Network Watcher Connection Monitor enables you to configure and track connection reachability, latency, and network topology changes. If there is an issue, it tells you why it occurred and how to fix it. 

## Network diagnostic tools

### IP flow verify
Network Watcher IP flow verify checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine based on 5-tuple information.
The security group decision and the name of the rule that denied the packet is returned.

### Next hop
Next Hop provides the next hop from the target virtual machine to the destination IP address.

### VPN troubleshoot
Network Watcher VPN Troubleshoot diagnoses the health of the virtual network gateway or connection. This request is a long running transaction, and the results are returned once the diagnosis is complete. You can select multiple gateways or connections to troubleshoot simultaneously.

### Packet capture


### Connection troubleshoot
