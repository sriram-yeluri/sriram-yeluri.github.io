Cloud Formation Template

* A template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure.
* A template is a declaration of the AWS resources that make up a stack.

### Intrinsic Functions

* Intrinsic functions are built in functions provided by AWS to manage the stack.
* Values assigned by the intrinsic functions are available only at run time.
